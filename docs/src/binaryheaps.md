# Binary heaps

[Binary heaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap) dynamically store values in a tree
structure built according to a given ordering of these values. Thanks to this structure, a
number of operations can be efficiently implemented. For a binary heap of `n` values,
pushing a new value, extracting the first value out of the heap, deleting a value, and
replacing a value all have a complexity of `O(log(n))` at worst. Just getting the first
value without extracting it out of the heap is an `O(1)` operation. Here, *values* means
objects of any type that implement an ordering rule, not necessarily numeric values.
Depending on the ordering chosen for the heap, the first value (also called the *root*
value) may be the least or the greatest one.


## Basic usage

In `QuickHeaps`, a binary heap is created by the [`BinaryHeap`](@ref) constructor:

```julia
h = BinaryHeap{T}(o = Forward)
```

where `T` is the type of the values stored by the heap and `o::Ordering` is the ordering
rule for sorting values. The default `Forward` ordering yields a *min-heap* whose root entry
is the smallest one. With `o = ReverseOrdering(Forward)` or `o = Reverse`, a *max-heap* is
created. The root element of a min-heap (resp. a max-heap) is the smallest one (resp. the
greatest one).

For floating-point values, orderings `FastMin` or `FastMax` may be used, respectively,
instead of `Forward` or `Reverse` for faster sorting of the heap. However, `FastMin` and
`FastMax` are not consistent with NaN (*Not a Number*) values. If your data may contains
NaNs, use `Forward` or `Reverse` instead of `FastMin` or `FastMax`. Aliases
`SafeMin=Forward` (and `SafeMax=Reverse`) are provided by the `QuickHeaps` package.

A vector `vals` storing the initial values of the binary heap can be specified:

```julia
h = BinaryHeap{T}(vals, o = Forward)
```

to create a binary heap starting with the values in `vals`. Type parameter `T` can be
omitted to assume `T=eltype(vals)`. The initial values need not be ordered, the `BinaryHeap`
constructor automatically takes care of that. If `vals` is a `Vector` instance with elements
of type `T`, the binary-heap will be directly built into `vals`. Call
`BinaryHeap(copy(vals))` to create a binary heap with its own storage.

A binary heap `h` can be used as an ordered queue of values:

```julia
pop!(h)     # yields the root value and discard it from the heap
push!(h, x) # pushes value x in heap h
```

The *root* value is the first one according to the ordering of the heap. To examine the root
value without discarding it from the heap, call either of:

```julia
peek(h)
first(h)
h[1]
```

A binary heap `h` behaves like an abstract vector (with 1-based linear indices), in
particular:

```julia
length(h)   # yields the number of values in heap h
h[i]        # yields the i-th value of heap h
h[i] = x    # sets the i-th value of heap h and heapify h
```

Note that `h[1]` is the value of the root entry of the heap `h` (the least heap values for a
min-heap, the greatest heap value for a max-heap) and that setting a value in the heap may
trigger reordering of the values stored by the heap to maintain the binary heap structure.
In particular, after doing `h[i] = x`, do not assume that `h[i]` yields `x` because the heap
`h` is automatically (and efficiently) re-ordered so as to maintain its heap structure.

To delete the `i`-th value from the heap `h`, call:

```julia
delete!(h, i)
```

Call `empty!(h)` to delete all the values of the binary heap `h` and `isempty(h)` to query
whether `h` is empty.

!!! note
    Operations that modify the heap, like deletion by `delete!(h,i)`, insertion by `h[i] =
    x`, pushing by `push!(h,x)`, and extracting by `pop!(h)` are of numerical complexity
    `O(1)` in the best case, `O(log(n))` in the worst case, with `n = length(h)` the number
    of values in the heap `h`. Query a given value with `peek(h)`, `first(h)`, or `h[i]` is
    always of complexity `O(1)`.


### Advanced usage

Instances of [`BinaryHeap`](@ref) store their values in a Julia vector whose length is
always equal to the number of stored values. Slightly faster binary heaps are created by the
[`FastBinaryHeap`](@ref) constructor. Such binary heaps never automatically reduce the size
of the array backing the storage of their values (even though the size is automatically
augmented as needed). You may call `resize!(h)` to explicitly reduce the storage to its
minimum.

A hint about the anticipated size `n` of a heap `h` (of any kind) can be set by:

```julia
sizehint!(h, n)
```

which yields `h`.


### Customize binary heaps

The behavior of the binary heap types provided by `QuickHeaps` can be tweaked by using a
particular instance of the ordering `o::Ordering` and by specializing the `Base.lt` method
called as `Base.lt(o,x,y)` to decide whether value `x` occurs before value `y` according to
ordering `o`. In the implementation of binary heaps by the `QuickHeaps` package, `x` and `y`
are always both of type `T`, the type of the values stored by the heap.

If this is not sufficient, a custom binary heap type may be created that inherits from
`AbstractBinaryHeap{T,O}` with `T` the type of the values stored by the heap and `O` the
type of the ordering. Assuming the array backing the storage of the values in the custom
heap type has 1-based linear indexing, it is sufficient to specialize the following methods
for an instance `h` of the custom heap type, say `CustomBinaryHeap`:

- `Base.length(h::CustomBinaryHeap)` yields the number of values in `h`;
- `Base.empty!(h::CustomBinaryHeap)` delete all values in `h`;
- [`QuickHeaps.storage`](@ref)`(h::CustomBinaryHeap)` yields the array backing the storage
  of values;
- [`QuickHeaps.ordering`](@ref)`(h::CustomBinaryHeap)`] yields the ordering of the values;
- [`QuickHeaps.unsafe_grow!`](@ref)`(h::CustomBinaryHeap, n::Integer)` to grow the size of the
  object backing the storage of `h` to have `n` elements;
- [`QuickHeaps.unsafe_shrink!`](@ref)`(h::CustomBinaryHeap, n::Integer)` to shrink the size
  of the object backing the storage of `h` to have `n` elements;

to have a fully functional custom binary heap type.

By default, `Base.resize!(h)` does nothing (except returning its argument) for any instance
`h` of a type that inherits from `AbstractBinaryHeap`; but this method may also be
specialized.

The `QuickHeaps` package provides a number of methods (some unexported) that may be useful
for implementing new binary heap types:

- [`QuickHeaps.heapify`](@ref)
- [`QuickHeaps.heapify!`](@ref)
- [`QuickHeaps.isheap`](@ref)
- [`QuickHeaps.heapify_down!`](@ref)
- [`QuickHeaps.heapify_up!`](@ref)
- [`QuickHeaps.unsafe_heapify_down!`](@ref)
- [`QuickHeaps.unsafe_heapify_up!`](@ref)


Note that the `heapify`, `heapify!`, and `isheap` functions which are exported by the
`QuickHeaps` package have the same behavior but are different than those in the
[`DataStructures`](https://github.com/JuliaCollections/DataStructures.jl) package. If you
are using both packages, you'll have to explicitly prefix these methods by the package
module.


## Simple priority queues

A binary heap can be used to implement a simple [priority
queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue) with keys of type `K` and values of
type `V` as follows:

```julia
struct Node{K,V}
   key::K
   val::V
end
Base.lt(o::Base.Ordering, a::T, b::T) where {T<:Node} = lt(o, a.val, b.val)
Q = FastBinaryHeap{Node}()
```

This simple priority queue is a binary heap (a *min-heap* in that case) of nodes storing
key-value pairs which as sorted according to their values. The same `Node` structure as the
one defined above and with the same specialization of `Base.lt` is provided (but not
exported) by `QuickHeaps`, so a simplified version of the above example is:

```julia
using QuickHeaps: Node
Q = FastBinaryHeap{Node}()
```

Such a priority queue is faster than `DataStructures.PriorityQueue` but it provides no means
to re-queue a node nor to ensure that keys are unique. An auxiliary array, a dictionary, or
a set can be used for that, this is implemented by [`QuickHeaps.PriorityQueue`](@ref) and
[`QuickHeaps.FastPriorityQueue`](@ref) which are more flexible and offer more capabilities
than the simple implementation in the above example.
