# Introduction

`QuickHeaps` is a [Julia](https://julialang.org/) package providing versatile [binary
heaps](binaryheaps.html) and [priority queues](priorityqueues.html). These data structures
are more flexible and usually faster than those provided by
[`DataStructures`](https://github.com/JuliaCollections/DataStructures.jl).
